"""ask_user: an agent asks the owner 1-4 multiple-choice questions in the chat and waits for the answers.

The turn blocks the way an approval does (remote.wait_approval), so the Activity inbox lists the question too. Every
question also takes a typed answer ("Other"). Only live chats get the tool: scheduled runs, Mega Plans and other
unattended turns have nobody to ask. If nobody answers within 30 minutes, or the turn is stopped, the agent is told to
end its turn; the card stays answerable in the chat and the answer then arrives as the user's next message.
