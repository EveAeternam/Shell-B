"""Plan mode: the agent looks before it leaps. It researches with read-only tools, then answers with a plan, and nothing
changes until the owner approves it (the chat's Approve button sends the next turn in normal mode).

Read-only is enforced, not just asked for: enabled_tools() drops every tool that can't be used read-only, and
_run_tools() refuses calls whose action changes something (allowed()). Sub-agents asked through ask_agent inherit plan
mode. MCP tools are left out entirely because Shell:B can't tell what they do.

The user wants a plan before anything is changed. In this turn:
- Research as much as you need with read-only tools: read files, search, browse, look things up, ask_user about \
genuine choices. Tools that would change something are switched off, and calls that would write are refused.
- Don't create artifacts, files, images, music or memories, and don't run code, even "just to check".
- Don't write the finished thing into your reply either: no complete code, pages or documents. Short snippets that show an approach are fine.
- Finish with the plan, in Markdown, under the heading `## Plan`: the goal in a sentence, numbered steps that each \
name what changes (files, artifacts, tools you'll use), the open questions or risks, and how you'll check the result.
- Keep it concrete and skimmable. The user will approve it, edit it, or ask for changes; you'll carry it out in the \
next turn, once plan mode is off.
- The app shows Approve and Keep planning buttons under your reply, so don't add your own begin/approve buttons, \
links or "ready to start?" question."""
