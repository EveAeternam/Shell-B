"""Feedback on replies: thumbs up/down, reasons, a note, and what Shell:B learns from them.

Each rating is stored in table `feedback` (one row per message; changing your mind replaces it) and mirrored into the
message's data as `feedback`, so the chat shows it after a reload. When the owner ticks "remember this" and says what
was wrong (or right), the utility model distills it into at most one lasting rule about how the owner wants answers,
saved as a `preference` memory (origin `feedback`). Preferences are core memories, so the rule is in every prompt
from the next message on. Feedback about this one answer only ("the date is wrong") yields no rule; the chat offers
"Try again with this feedback" instead.

The table also keeps per-agent counts, which the nightly reflection (backlog C4) can mine for patterns.

If lasting, write ONE short rule in the third person ("{name} prefers …", "{name} wants …", "Never …"), general enough
to apply to future conversations and specific enough to act on. Never guess: if the feedback doesn't say what they want
instead (e.g. just "wrong tone" with no hint of which tone), return an empty rule. If your rule refines or contradicts a known preference
below, put that preference's id in "replaces". If a known preference already says the same thing, return an empty rule.
