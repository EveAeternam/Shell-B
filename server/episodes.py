"""Episodic memory: Shell:B remembers past conversations, not just facts (memory.py).

Two indexes over every conversation (chats, chat Projects, Studio/Code threads, unattended runs):
  msg_fts       SQLite FTS5 over message text, kept in sync by triggers on `messages`, so every writer (db.py,
                deletions, regenerations) is covered without code changes there.
  conv_summary  a 1-3 sentence summary per conversation by the utility model, plus its embedding. A background sweep
                (`start`) writes them for conversations whose message count changed and that have been quiet for a
                minute. It waits while anyone is chatting and shares memory.py's lock so the GPU sees one job at a time.

Agents get `recall_conversations` (search, then read), and the system prompt lists a few recent conversations with
their summaries so there is continuity between chats. The sidebar search uses `/api/chats/search`.
